Python Object Oriented Programming
In this tutorial, you'll learn about 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python and
its fundamental concept with the help of examples.



Object Oriented Programming
Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. 
It supports different programming approaches.

One of the popular approaches to solve a programming 
problem is by creating objects. 
This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

An object has two characteristics:

attributes
behavior
Let's take an example:

A parrot is an object, as it has the following properties:

name, age, color as attributes
singing, dancing as behavior
The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating 
reusable code. This concept is also known 
as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

In Python,
the concept of OOP follows some basic principles:

Class
A class is a blueprint for the object.

We can think of class as a sketch of a parrot with labels. It contains all the details about the name, colors, size etc. Based on these descriptions, we can study about the parrot. Here, a parrot is an object.

The example for class of parrot can be :

class Parrot:
    pass
Here, we use the class keyword to define an empty class Parrot. From class, we construct instances. An instance is a specific object created from a particular class.

Object
An object (instance) is an instantiation of a class. When class is defined, only the description for the object is defined. Therefore, no memory or storage is allocated.
